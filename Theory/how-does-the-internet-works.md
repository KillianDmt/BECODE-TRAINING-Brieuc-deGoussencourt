##how-does-the interet-works?

1. A **client** (any hardware that can connect to the internet) sends a *request* to a server. 

	Each client has a unique **IP adress**.

2. Thanks to a network of cables connected via **routers** the request is moving towards its destination (the server) to retrieve information. Each time it goes through a diffenrent router, the signal gets a new layer of the IP adress of the router so it can find its way back to the client once it reached the server.

3. The server retrieves the request and **sends back** the answer (website, email, data,...) thanks to a chain of IP adress.
